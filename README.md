# parallel-random-forest
Implement parallel random forest with python, source code under 'Implement RF' folder;

Implement LR with python, source code under 'Implement LR' folder;

Easy image classification task, source code under 'Easy image classification' folder, I  use Pretrained ResNet101 here, actually, the more complex the network is, the better result you can get. So you can down load pretrained network such as ResNeXt-101-32x4d from github https://github.com/Cadene/pretrained-models.pytorchs, and fine tune the parameters.
